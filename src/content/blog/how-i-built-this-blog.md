# How I Built This Blog 💻

This blog began as an exploration into building static sites with React + Gatsby + MDX, and turned into a personal portfolio and learning space for all my creative and technical work.

<em>This post uses Markdown, but allows React too!</em>

---

## 👨‍🎓 Learning Journey

Earlier this year, I attended an in-depth frontend course at [Trivera Tech](https://www.triveratech.training/course/tt4190-250602-jpmc) that gave me hands-on experience with modern JavaScript frameworks, TypeScript, and UI libraries. This laid the foundation for a deeper dive into React-based site generation and performance optimization.

## 🔧 Phase 1: Gatsby + MDX Blog Prototype

The first iteration of this site used **Gatsby.js** with **MDX** for combining Markdown content with interactive React components.

### Key Technologies

- **Gatsby.js** – SEO-optimized static site generator  
- **MDX** – Combine Markdown with live React components  
- **React Icons** – For scalable iconography  
- **Vercel** – Fast deployment and custom domain hosting  
- **Vanilla CSS** – Simple inline styles for fast iteration  

### Features

- Interactive blog posts using embedded components  
- Dynamic header/footer that hides on scroll  
- Sections for writing, projects, bookshelf, and art  
- Fully responsive layout with semantic HTML  

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

Deployed to Vercel with GitHub integration and a custom domain.

## 🔁 Phase 2: Vite + Tailwind React Portfolio (Inspired by Brittany Chiang)

To explore a leaner, developer-centric stack, I created a second version using **Vite**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**:

### 🏗️ Project Setup

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-new-site -- --template react-ts
cd my-new-site
npm install
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

- **Routing:** React Router DOM with multi-page support (Home, About, Experience, Projects)  
- **Layout:** Grid-based layout with a fixed sidebar  

```tsx
<main className="grid grid-cols-[200px_1fr] h-screen">
  <aside className="fixed left-0 top-0 p-6 text-teal-400">...</aside>
  <section className="ml-[200px] overflow-y-auto">...</section>
</main>
```

### ✨ Features

- About section with personal background and tech stack  
- Projects showcased using card layouts  
- Experience timeline via `react-vertical-timeline-component`  
- Deep navy theme with teal accents  
- Fully responsive with Tailwind utilities  
- Deployed to [my-personal-site-tan-zeta.vercel.app](https://my-personal-site-tan-zeta.vercel.app)

## 🧩 Final Site: Personal Portfolio Blog

Eventually, I merged the best of both approaches into a single cohesive site: a blog + portfolio built with Gatsby and styled for clarity, responsiveness, and elegance.
