# How I Built This Blog 💻

I've always wanted a personal space online, so I built this blog from scratch using **React + Gatsby + MDX**.

<em>This post uses Markdown, but allows React too!</em>

Here’s what powers it:
- 🛠 Gatsby
- ✍️ MDX
- 🎨 Custom components

You’re reading this from a `.mdx` file, not a `.js` one!
